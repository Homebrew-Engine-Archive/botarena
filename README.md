# BotArena

BotArena (was) a game engine for MtG. It (was) written in C++ and was Windows only. The latest release was version 1.49.3 (release date: 2015-05-25)  

This is a copy of the source code of BotArena. The original [subversion repository](http://svn.xp-dev.com/svn/BAOS/trunk) seems to be down and I couldn't find the source code anywhere else. I tried to recreate the branches based on an old local checkout, but based on the nature of subversion the commit history is lost.

It seems the source will not build with the current Visual Studio 2019 and the Qt frontend was never in a usable state. So to make it work again, it would need some love.
